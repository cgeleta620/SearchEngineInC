The authors used a combination of conventional planar Tc-99m glucoheptonate
(GH) and single photon emission CT (SPECT) scintigraphy in the evaluation
of ten children with renal transplants. A conventional perfusion study
was performed at the time of administration of Tc-99m GH, followed by
sequential 500,000-count scintiphotos obtained at 5-minute intervals
for 1 hour. Then SPECT imaging was performed. Images were reconstructed
in transaxial, sagittal, and coronal planes. The authors identified abnormalities
that were not readily apparent or were even inapparent on conventional
radionuclide urograms. The lesions revealed included renal fracture,
segmental ischemia, and lymphocele formation. In every instance information
derived from the SPECT study contributed in a meaningful manner to the
clinical evaluation of these patients.
